            <p>
              The Lord's teaching tells us that life exists beyond our time on
              Earth. In our personal relationship with Him, we not only
              experience authentic life now, but in the life to come.
            </p>

            <p>
              He gives eternal life. When we follow Jesus, we grow stronger and
              become more like Him. We should remember Him and follow Him like
              sunflowers follow the sun across the sky. Following His light and
              example will bring us joy, happiness, and peace, even if things
              around us are hard.

                  The Mount of Beatitudes is a hill in Northern Israel on the
                  Korazim Plateau. It is the spot where Jesus is believed to
                  have delivered his Sermon on the Mount. Overlooking the
                  northwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee, the mount offers
                  enchanting views of the northern part of the lake and across
                  to the cliffs of the Golan Heights.

                  The Mount of Beatitudes, believed to be the setting for Jesus'
                  most famous discourse, the Sermon on the Mount, is one of the
                  most beautifully serene places in the Holy Land.

                <p>
                  Nazareth is a city in Israel with biblical history. In the old
                  city, the domed Basilica of the Annunciation is, some believe,
                  where the angel Gabriel told Mary she would bear a child.

                <p>
                  Growing up in Nazareth, Jesus learned carpentry and stonework
                  from His father, Joseph. As an adult, He returns to Nazareth
                  and at the synagogue He confesses to be the fulfillment of the
                  prophet Isaiah's words in Luke 4:18-19.

                  Cana is an Arab village nestled in the mountains the lower
                  Galilee. It's about 11 miles (17 km.) southwest of the Sea of
                  Galilee, about 4 miles (6.4 km.) northeast of Nazareth, and
                  about 22 miles (35 km.)

                <p>
                  This location is mentioned in the Bible to be the place of the
                  first miracle of Jesus, who turned water into wine on the
                  occasion of a wedding feast. The Shrine of Jesus' First
                  Miracle is located here, under the custody of the Franciscans,
                  who have been present in Cana for three centuries.
